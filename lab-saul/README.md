### Cowsay / React App (lab 26)

* I used the lecture code as a base source for my code and then tweaked it to include cowsay lorem ipsum instead of being a counter. This required instal of cowsay and faker since i used faker to generate the lorem ipsum that the cowsay was generating. I also tweaked the SASS a bit.
